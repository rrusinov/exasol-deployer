Add the exasol init command cloud specifc, eg. cloud-provider is required as argument on first place. Cloud providers could be aws, gcp, azure, and everything else which is supported by open tofu and ansible. Check which init options are cloud specific and which not, the cloud specific options should be renamed to have prefix the cloud provider. Keep all other options to have the same regardless of the cloud provider. Adjust the opentofu templates (ansible if needed) to support every cloud which can be configured. Add also spot instance options in exasol init for every cloud which support that and adjust the opentofu templates to use it. Ensure that the opentofu runs in a way that deployment is run in availbility zone which have all needed number of instances and instance types we want to use.

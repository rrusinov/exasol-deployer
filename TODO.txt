Check what options do we have to have public available hostname with valid certificate, eventually having a load balancer to he open ports.

The public signed certificate can be be installed (and needs to be installed) on all machines with: ssh cos confd_client cert_update ca: '"{< /root/tls_ca}"' cert: '"{< /root/tls_cert}"' key: '"{< /root/tls_key}"' || true


Add way to see the needed permissions in order to deploy the infrastructure to the specific cloud. (eg. exasol --print-permissions [--deployment-dir])
For example this tool:  https://github.com/JamesWoolfenden/pike which can be run locally in docker or podman (fallback) can be used to find the information I need. You can print json output like this:

cloud specic permissions: 
REQUIRED_PERMISSIONS = {
    // EC2 Permissions - Core compute and networking
    ec2: [
        'ec2:RunInstances',
        'ec2:DescribeInstanceAttribute',
        ...
    ],
    // VPC and Networking
    vpc: [
        'ec2:CreateVpc',
        'ec2:DeleteVpc',
        ...
    ],
    ...
}

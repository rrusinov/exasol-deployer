# Python dependencies for Exasol Deployer helper scripts
# These dependencies are required for the Python helper scripts in lib/python/

# Standard library modules are used (re, sys, argparse, etc.)
# No external dependencies required - only Python 3.6+ standard library

# The helper scripts use only built-in Python modules:
# - re: Regular expressions for parsing shell scripts and documentation
# - sys: System interface and command-line argument handling
# - os: Operating system interface (for path operations)
# - argparse: Command-line argument parsing (in some helpers)

# Minimum Python version requirement:
# Python >= 3.6

# Note: These helper scripts are designed to work with the Python standard library only
# to minimize external dependencies and ensure broad compatibility.

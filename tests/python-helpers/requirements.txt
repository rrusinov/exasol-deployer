# Python dependencies for Exasol Deployer helper scripts
# These dependencies are required for the Python helper scripts in tests/python-helpers/

# The helper scripts use only built-in Python modules:
# - re: Regular expressions for parsing shell scripts and documentation
# - sys: System interface and command-line argument handling
# - os: Operating system interface (for path operations)
# - argparse: Command-line argument parsing (in some helpers)

# Minimum Python version requirement:
# Python >= 3.6

# Note: All helper scripts use only Python standard library modules.
# YAML validation is handled by yamllint (external binary tool).
